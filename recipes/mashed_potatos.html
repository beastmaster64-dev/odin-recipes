    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water by about 1 inch. 
            Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until tender and 
            easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain potatoes, then return to the pot. 
            Turn heat to high and allow potatoes to 
            dry for about 30 seconds. Turn off heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mash potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, 
            then mash in milk and butter until smooth and fluffy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt and black; whisk until evenly distributed, about 15 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
